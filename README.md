## PROJECT: MY CITY
This is a learning project from the Google Android Studio course. In this project, I applied knowledge from Lessons 1 to 4 to develop an Android application that provides information and recommends activities and places to visit in my city.

## KEY FEATURES

- Display information by category and suggest featured locations.
- Integrate direct links to Google Maps for navigation support.
- Support printing introduction slips when the application runs on SUNMI POS devices with built-in printers.
